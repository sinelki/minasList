    <div id="shinkai-quote" class="about-wrapper">
    	<p id="quote">"We need women with a vision, women who are really committed to changing the lives of other women...If we do not bring women into politics, if we do not increase their number, if we do not have a specific agenda, I do not think our political counterparts will be willing to listen. So who is going to do that? The best way is to have strong, committed, mission-driven women inside the parliament to lobby, advocate, and claim the rights of half the population."</p>

    	<h2>WHY WE DO IT</h2>
    	<p id="first">Women make up less than 20 percent of parliamentarians around the world, and in thirty seven states women account for less than 10 percent of representatives in single or lower houses.</p>
    	<p id="second">The 2011 UN General Assembly resolution on women’s political participation notes: 
“Women in every part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the political sphere, often as a result of discriminatory laws, practices, attitudes and gender stereotypes, low levels of education, lack of access to health care, and the disproportionate effect of poverty on women.”</p>

    	<p id="third">Even when elected to national government, women policy-makers may lack the sufficient skills or willingness to address issues of gender equality. This is why Mina’s List is working towards equal and substantive representation, which means that women parliamentarians are both willing and able to advocate for women’s interests in the political arena.</p>
    	<p id="fourth">The presence of women in government is important not only to secure the equal rights of women, but for the nature of governance itself. Research shows that when women are empowered as political leaders, more laws are passed to promote women’s rights and countries experience higher standards of living, including positive developments in education, infrastructure and health, and tangible gains for democratic governance, such as decreased corruption, greater cooperation across party and ethnic lines, and more sustainable peace. For example:</p>
