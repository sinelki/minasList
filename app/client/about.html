	<h2>WHY WE DO IT</h2>
    	<p id="first">Women make up less than 20 percent of parliamentarians around the world, and in thirty seven states women account for less than 10 percent of representatives in single or lower houses.</p>
    	<p id="second">The 2011 UN General Assembly resolution on women’s political participation notes: 
“Women in every part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the political sphere, often as a result of discriminatory laws, practices, attitudes and gender stereotypes, low levels of education, lack of access to health care, and the disproportionate effect of poverty on women.”</p>

    <div id="shinkai-quote" class="about-wrapper">
    	<p id="quote">"We need women with a vision, women who are really committed to changing the lives of other women...If we do not bring women into politics, if we do not increase their number, if we do not have a specific agenda, I do not think our political counterparts will be willing to listen. So who is going to do that? The best way is to have strong, committed, mission-driven women inside the parliament to lobby, advocate, and claim the rights of half the population."</p>
